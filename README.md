# Why
A truely random salt significantly enhances security, especially in contexts involving hashing and password storage, as it is not deterministic and resistant to Pre-Computed Attacks as well as Brute Force Attacks.

No warranty, but feel free to test it with a [Shannon Entropy Calculator](https://planetcalc.com/2476/).
# How

The entropy source is the uncertainty of time spent on bogosort benchmark in 0.1Î¼s scale.
The entropy is magnified with transcendentals and mathematical operations.
